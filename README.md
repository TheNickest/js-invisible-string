# js-invisible-strings

Inspired by [Medium Blog Post](https://medium.com/@6465660/javascript-magic-tricks-invisible-characters-cf0aa203f1b8), implemented in TypeScript and Bun.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.3. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
